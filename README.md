# MontModExp-radix2
A quick java implementation of Montgomery Modular Exponentiation using the Tenca-Koc radix-2 algorithm, intended for use in an RSA cryptosystem

This was written purely to aid in debugging the algorithm in hardware. Details on the algorithm can be found in Alexandre Koc's excellent publication here: https://koclab.cs.ucsb.edu/docs/koc/r02.pdf
